# Please complete the following

#     Write a function average_neg_evens that takes a list of numbers as a parameter, and adds all the negative even numbers (less than 0 and divisible by 2) together and returns their average.

#     Example function call:

#     print(average_neg_evens([0, 1, 2, -2, -3, -4, 3, 4]))

#     Outputs: -3

#     Write a function count_letter that takes a list of strings and a string letter as parameters and returns the number of times this letter occurs, both upper- & lower-cased.

#     Example function call:

#     list = [“HELLO”, “goodbye”, “1234 Oooh!”]
#     print(count_letter(list, “o”))

#     Outputs: 6

# Things to remember when submitting:

#     For full credit, you must use a while loop once somewhere in your program.
#     Your program should be ordered as follows: leading comment, any imports, function definitions, then lastly a main
#     When testing your functions (by calling them in main), make sure to also include some descriptive output to determine if your test passed or failed
